# OpenAPI generated server

Spring Boot Server

## Overview
This server was generated by the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) project.
By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://openapis.org), you can easily generate a server stub.
This is an example of building a OpenAPI-enabled server in Java using the SpringBoot framework.


The underlying library integrating OpenAPI to Spring Boot is [springdoc](https://springdoc.org).
Springdoc will generate an OpenAPI v3 specification based on the generated Controller and Model classes.
The specification is available to download using the following url:
http://localhost:8080/v3/api-docs/

Start your server as a simple java application

You can view the api documentation in swagger-ui by pointing to
http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html

Change default port value in application.properties


## Reload DB Schema using postgres
If you have to recreate the dB schema in postgres, for example as a foundation for the jooq generator, 
you may load the schema file to postgres directly using 

code psql -h localhost -U postgres -d profiling_db -f src/main/resources/schema.sql
