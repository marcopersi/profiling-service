# OpenAPI generated server

Spring Boot Server

## Overview
This server was generated by the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) project.
By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://openapis.org), you can easily generate a server stub.
This is an example of building a OpenAPI-enabled server in Java using the SpringBoot framework.

The underlying library integrating OpenAPI to Spring Boot is [springdoc](https://springdoc.org).
Springdoc will generate an OpenAPI v3 specification based on the generated Controller and Model classes.
The specification is available to download using the following url:
http://localhost:8080/v3/api-docs/

Start your server as a simple java application

You can view the api documentation in swagger-ui by pointing to
http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html

Change default port value in application.properties

# Starting profiling-service 
If you just would like to try the service use the docker-compose.yml file of the project. 
<code> docker compose up -d docker-compose.yml</code> 
does the job for you and provides:

* a postgres database server container which is listening on port 5433
* a pgadmin container which is running on port 3330
* a profiling service server container which is listening on port 8080

## Reload DB Schema using postgres
If you have to recreate the dB schema in postgres, for example as a foundation for the jooq generator, 
you may load the schema file to postgres directly using 

code psql -h localhost -U postgres -d profiling_db -f src/main/resources/schema.sql    

Where the 
* -U is the userId
* -d is the databaseName
* -f is the source of your DB Schema
* -h is obviously the host/IP

# Registering the DB Server at PGAdmin
If you would like to use PGAdmin (visual UI to manage the database), this is provided in the docker-compose.yml file for you. But after the login, you need to register the postgres database server within PGAdmin. 
Use the following properties to do that

* host: use the value host.docker.internal 
* port: obviously 5433
* user: postgres 
* password: per default password, except you've changed it
